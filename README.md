# DrawNoBet
Remake of betting tips page Draw No Bet. Now it is REST API.

LAUNCH APPLICATION:
1. The repository contains an example database file (it called "drawnobet") that you can use (import in HeidiSQL).
2. Type in terminal: npm start
3. Then go http://localhost:3000

DESCRIPTION:
The site is used to view betting tips. The user can add his types and edit (or delete) them.
You can also view the statistics of the billed tips.

This is an early version of the remake of the website,
which had a user registration and login system and was expanded with advanced options for viewing types,
more accurate statistics divided into individual periods and a chat where users could exchange their opinions.
The earlier version of the website was based on PHP technology. This currently works on JavaScript and NodeJS.

Everything still needs to be done :)
